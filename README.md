# LeetCode Problems

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems, organized using a naming convention to maintain order.

## Naming Convention

To ensure that the order of packages and classes is maintained, we've chosen to use a specific naming convention.

### Packages

Each package in this repository starts with the prefix `aaa_` (lowercase) followed by a short description of the topic covered by the package. For example, `aaa_strings` contains solutions to LeetCode problems related to strings.

### Classes

Each class in this repository starts with the prefix `AAA_` (uppercase) followed by a short description of the problem being solved. For example, `AAA_TwoSum` contains a solution to the LeetCode problem "Two Sum."

## Why this Naming Convention?

We understand that this naming convention might differ from the standard naming convention used in Java development. However, we've chosen this convention for two reasons:

1. To maintain the order of packages and classes, making it easier to locate and revise code.
2. To clearly differentiate LeetCode problems from other Java projects or code.
